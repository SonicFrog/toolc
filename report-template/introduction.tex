During this semester we implemented a compiler for the Tool language.
We first wrote a lexer that transforms a stream of characters in a sequence of tokens.
This stream is token is then transformed into an abstract syntax tree by the parser of our compiler.
Once we have our tree it is then analyzed for correctness by the name analyzer and the type checker.
The last step is translating the abstract syntax tree to actual executable code. Our original target was Java byte code for execution on a JVM.

Our extension aims to compile Tool to Javascript instead of Java bytecode, thus allowing Tool to be executed inside a browser. This allowed us to add many features to the Tool language. Those features are described throughout this document.
