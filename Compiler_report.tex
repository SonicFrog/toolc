\section{Goals}

\section{Translation from Tool to JavaScript}
\subsection{Tool Classes as Objects}
\subsection{Prototyping instead of inheritance}
\subsection{Generation of the script file}

\section{Tool Enhancement}
\subsection{IO Functions}
Tool's greatest limitation is its lack of interaction with the user. JavaScript, on the  contrary, has some already implemented functions for all those purposes.
\subsubsection{Input gestion}
\subsubsection{Output gestion}

\subsection{New Types}
Another great limitation of Tool is that it only support very basic types. Which is why the support for Double and any type of Array has been added to the grammar of Tool.
\subsubsection{Double}
Integer are now defined as a subtype of double for simplification purposes.
You can concatenate a Double with a String.
\subsubsection{Array of any Types}
\subsubsection{Array of more than one dimension}
\subsection{Parametrized constructor}
They have to have a different type
