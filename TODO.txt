JS doesn't allow to have fields and methods with the same name!

parametrized constructor










SOLVED:

can concat boolean

problem with the equals and TArray as an absolute.  <-- should be fixed

accessing and initiating multi dimension arrays is a mess.   <-- seems fixed

float instead of double as it seems there is no double in JavaScript <- we don't care

legacy support for println <-- has been re-added

write // writeln  <-- we don't care

"int / int" is still considered Int for legacy support purpose

Logging feature addition as IO.log(msg) <-- done

comparator for double needs to be set up <-- done

pre tag added to keep the console-like printing

forced a monospace font again to keep the console-like printing

slots[i][j].methodcall() should be allowed < -- fixed now parsing for method call even after the arrayread detection.

force int / int as an integer otherwise strange things happens <-- fixed with a type checking in the PrinterJS and a Math.floor call.

for statement ? Foreach ? Map? <-- we don't care
